**&emsp; `Read in Doug Demuro voice ~`** "_This_ 1986 Volkswagen Golf GTI was first sold by Casey Imports of Newport News, Virginia, and was acquired by the selling dealer in October 2023. The car is powered by a 1.8-liter inline-four paired with a five-speed manual transaxle and is finished in black over gray cloth upholstery. Equipment includes 14″ alloy wheels, four-wheel disc brakes, a sport suspension, a 16-valve-style front lip spoiler, a sunroof, a rear spoiler, air conditioning, and a factory “Sound Choice” SC 73 ETR radio. This Mk2 GTI shows 168k miles and is now offered at no reserve by the selling dealer with a window sticker, manufacturer’s literature, service records, a Carfax report, and a clean Pennsylvania title."
