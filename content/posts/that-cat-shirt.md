In 2016 my girlfriend and I adopted a five-month-old calico cat, Nyx. We chose her based on her outgoing personality, tree climber attitude and because she was a calico. She fast became the center of our lives. A few months into ownership Sabrina got it in her head Nyx was in dire need of a hoodie. A short amazon delivery later Nyx was immortalized forever.

We thought it was such a funny photo it needed to be on a t-shirt. We ordered plain white t-shirts with Nyx's picture dead-center on them through Custom Ink. When one of us would wear the t-shirt we would get compliments and questions on where to get it, so... fast forward one weekend later.
