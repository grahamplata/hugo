Inspired by the OpenDota Web UI I created a simple scored card for viewing Dota 2 data. This utilizes the OpenDota API, which is also an open source project. The purpose was to strengthen my react skills and learn a bit of redux along the way. The app provides a bite-sized view of players recent dota stats.

> Dota is a multiplayer video game in which two teams of five players compete to collectively destroy a large structure defended by the opposing team known as the "Ancient", whilst defending their own.

This game united my friend group through our formative years. I was first introduced to the game during a weekend LAN party I had with friends. At the time Dota had many shortcomings, this was the time of private lobbies, frequent disconnects, and constant map downloads. Even with all its hard edges, it united our friend group into one focused effort. I can attribute Dota for keeping my friend group together when we departed for college. 10 years later we are still going strong. It's amazing how far the game has come.
