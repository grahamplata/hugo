> Phở or pho is a Vietnamese soup consisting of broth, rice noodles, herbs, and meat, sometimes chicken. Pho is a popular street food in Vietnam and served in restaurants around the world -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pho)

I was introduced to pho by a good friend... and it is by far one of my most favorite things to eat.

Optional

- Chili garlic sauce
- Jalapeño pepper
- Sriracha

## Directions

- **Roast the bones and onions**
  - Roasting the beef bones and onions will unlock a lot more flavor
  - Preheat oven to 425 degrees F
  - Place beef bones and onions on baking sheets and roast until they develop color
- **Making the broth**
  - Place the bones, quartered onion, cinnamon, halved ginger, salt, star anise, and fish sauce in a large stockpot or crockpot and cover with water until it is about 2 inches from the top.
  - It helps when straining to put the spices in a teaball or muslin pouch.
  - Bring to a boil then reduce heat to low. Simmer on low for 6 to 10 hours. ~ **_low and slow_**
  - Feel free to skim any scum that may form on the surface.
  - Strain the broth into a large saucepan and set aside.
- **Prep the steak**
  - Freeze the raw steak for 10-15 minutes, so it's easier to manage with your sharp knife.
  - Slice the steak as thin as you can and place in the fridge until ready to serve.
- **Prep the noodles**
  - Just follow the package instructions.
  - Divide noodles among the serving bowls.
- **Assemble the garnishes**
  - Plate the Thai basil, bean sprouts, lime wedges, hoisin sauce, chili garlic sauce, and sliced jalapeño on the side.
- **To serve**
  - Divide noodles among serving bowls
  - Top with sirloin, cilantro, and green onion.
  - Pour hot broth over the top and let sit until the beef is partially cooked and no longer pink.
  - Add garnishes.
  - Enjoy!

## Notes

Feel free to substitute the sirloin for chicken breast.
I have had good results with the slow cooker in smaller batches.
