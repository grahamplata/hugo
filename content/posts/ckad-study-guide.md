## Context

**_[Certified Kubernetes Application Developer or "CKAD"](https://www.cncf.io/certification/ckad/)_**

A certification from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), which validates that users can design, build, configure, and expose cloud native applications for Kubernetes.

**Why did you pursue this certification?**

I pursued this certification because Syapse switched to a microservices architecture at using Kubernetes. My thought process was that this would be a great way to validate my skills learned over the past two years during the migration.

## My Objectives

- Pass the exam!
- Grasp the concepts in building and maintaining Kubernetes applications.
- Share what I have learned.

## Practice tools and Study Guides

- Certified Kubernetes Application Developer Udemy Course

  - I started my studies with this [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-application-developer/) taught by Mumshad Mannambeth. His course stepped through all concepts that are covered by the current exam. A nice bonus is that there are labs that accompany each lesson and two practice exams.

- dgkanatsios' Study Guide

  - Dgkanatsios prepared a set of exercises to prepare for Certified Kubernetes Application Developer exam.
  - [Github link](https://github.com/dgkanatsios/CKAD-exercises)

### Tools

- [Killer.sh](Killer.sh)

  - A test environment built to mimic the real exam. The CKAD Simulator came with 20 scenarios in which you attempt solve in the same 2 hours. When time expires you get access to the solutions and an automated score.

- [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

  - minikube is local Kubernetes, focusing on making it easy to learn and develop for Kubernetes. This works great with free resources like [dgkanatsios' Study Guide](https://github.com/dgkanatsios/CKAD-exercises) linked above.

  - ```shell
    # mac users who get stuck on docker/virtualbox
    brew install virtualbox
    minikube start --vm-driver virtualbox
    ```

- Know enough Vim to get by
  - Knowing to select, delete and copy quickly will help speed up your efficiency.
  - `h j k l` or `arrow keys` movement
  - `i` enter insert mode
  - `dd` delete current line
  - `u` undo last action
  - `Ctrl + r` redo last action
  - `p` delete current line
  - `v` visually select multiple lines
  - `y` yank/copy
  - `:set number` Adds numbers to the gutter
  - `:wq` save and quit

## The Exam

### Question Format

> In the namespace yellow there is a deployment named webapp. Team Yellow needs it to be more reliable. Please add a liveness-probe which checks the container on port 80. Instruct the probe to wait 10 seconds before probing and periodically check every 15 seconds. The original deployment yaml is available at /webapp.yaml. Save your changes at /answer/wabapp-new.yaml.

### Tips

- If you use any extra tools in your day job to make your life easier ([kubens](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx)) be mindful that they will not be available on test day.
- Proactively make bookmarks when studying to use on exam day. Just make sure to only use one additional tab.
- Make use of the provided cheatsheet in the [k8s docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/).
- Use Autocompletion

  - ```shell
    source <(kubectl completion bash)
    echo "source <(kubectl completion bash)" >> ~/.bashrc
    ```

- Alias kubectl to k

  - ```shell
    alias k=kubectl
    complete -F __start_kubectl k
    ```

- The exam happens in the browser and the provided terminal can be laggy and quite clumsy at times.
- `kubectl explain` and `kubectl --help` are the fastest way to get answers if you get stuck.
- If you are having trouble with a question flag it for later.
- For every question you are given a context command. Get in the habbit of running it before each question as you don't want to mix up environments. There are 4.

### Exam Day

Make sure you read the [instructions!](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/tc-docs/certification/tips-cka-and-ckad)

The test...

- The CKAD is 20 questions with tasks.
- You have 2 hours to complete the exam.
- Tasks are solved in the command line on Linux.
- The exams are proctored via streaming audio, video, and screen sharing feeds.
- Results will be emailed 36 hours from the time that the exam is completed.

## Closing thoughts

- Practice practice practice. _"Slow is Smooth, Smooth is Fast."_
- My results appeared at the 36 hour mark. Waiting was worse than the preperation.
- Practicing with a clock builds confidence.
- Best of Luck!
