This beautiful specimen came into my possession after discovering this [Bring A Trailer](https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1986-volkswagen-golf-gti-5/) listing while searching for my first "project" car. "Toonami" is a one-owner, straight-four GTI 8v with a lively history and over **186,000** miles on the clock. _I have with plans to add many more._

So... "What is a project car?" To me a project car was always meant to be something to learn from. I was drawn to the Volkswagen platform for its quirkiness, platform sharing and the community.

What have I learned?

**Just Buy the Bentley Manual**

> The Volkswagen GTI, Golf, Jetta Service Manual: 1985-1992 is a definitive reference source of technical automotive repair and maintenance information for Volkswagen GTI, Golf, Jetta models built on the A2 platform from 1985 through 1992.

[Link](http://www.bentleypublishers.com/volkswagen/repair-information/vw-jetta-golf-1985-1992-repair-manual.html) - This by far is the most invaluable tool. Being able to quickly query an issue with excellent directions is a gift!

**Refresh components when you can**

While replacing the struts with coilovers I used the opritunity to replace the rubber bushings as well.

**Older car parts _can_ be tough to find**

Non-consumable components can be difficult to find so it's nice to have spares.
