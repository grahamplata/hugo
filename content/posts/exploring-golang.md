## Go 76ers

### Learning Go

A goal of the past year for me was to become more familiar with go lang.

> Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

A simple cli for following my favorite NBA team

```shell
Usage:
  sixers [command]

Available Commands:
  help        Help about any command
  next        Gets the next available sixers game date and time.
  record      Gets the 76ers record for the current season.

Flags:
      --config string   config file (default is $HOME/.sixers.yaml)
  -h, --help            help for sixers
  -t, --toggle          Help message for toggle

Use "sixers [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```
