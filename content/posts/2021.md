## Little Victories

### Experiencing travel outside the United States

This year Sabrina and I took our first big [vacation](https://www.grahamplata.com/posts/nevis/)! It's been a goal of ours since we have been dating to travel more ***(it only took 7 years)*** but we finally did it! We went to the small island of Nevis and its neighboring island Saint Kitts. Although we had some interesting travel issues it didn't keep us from experiencing incredible views!

### Bike Riding

I am proud that I have found an activity that holds my interest. I have been struggling to find exercise that I can enjoy as much as I did club soccer. Below is an excerpt of one of my favorite rides from this year.

## Personal Goals

### Professional Development

Learning to earn or maintain professional credentials such as academic degrees to formal coursework.

#### Certifications

A goal I never knew I wanted to achieve this year was a Kubernetes certification. This was a big milestone for me as I was never a good test taker and I really felt like I achieved something in the end.

Previously located on the [About](grahamplata.com/about) page

#### Open Source Contributions

I was able to contribute to a few Go packages, some documentations/examples in an Apache incubator project and an infastructure as code action. I look forward to contributing more in the future.

## Difficulties

### COVID-19

No explanation needed.

### Taking breaks and mindfulness

I do a very poor job of this. A goal for the coming year would be taking moments to pause, exhale, and accept myself as I am today. Nothing to improve, just focusing on being happy and content in the moment.
