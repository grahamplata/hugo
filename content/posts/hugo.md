After some time, I finally decided to move my blog away from [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

Gatsby was a fantastic project to be a part of but over the past few months, I felt I was underutilizing the features it offered. Gatsby is an open-source framework based on React used for static site generation.

Something I learned from my past life in video production was to not worry as much about the technology and focus on the content. It is a common trap many creators fall into. I fell into the trap with gatsby.

All I want now is to write my content push it and walk away. I started fresh and called it a learning experience.

Welcome, Hugo.
Thank you, Gatsby.

> Note: I am sure I will get bored of this and swap back in 6 months.
