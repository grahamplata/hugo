# Nyx's green thumb.

> A photo dialogue of Nyx the cat and her new garden planter.

In an act of rebellion against the remaining bit of weekend, Nyx and Sabrina started a third-floor garden. Armed with dirt, herbs, and a desire to prolong Sunday the duo teamed up.

# Herbs and why we chose them

- _Cilantro_ - chosen because it's great to have around for street tacos
- _Lavendar_ - is great when infused as an essential oil to relieve tension headaches, encourage a good night's rest, and even helps to keep bugs away.
- _Rosemary_ - is great for cooking, especially for roasts and even in cocktails.
- _Mint_ - helps soothe an upset stomach, goes great in mojitos, lemonade, tea, and also acts as a bug repellent.
