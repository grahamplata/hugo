Whenever I want to learn something new I always try to tie it into a project. I stumbled on gatsbyJS while doing research on blogging platforms. For the past few months, I had been deep into React development and gatsby dovetailed into my workflow.

Fast forward... This site was built with Gatsby and I hope that it is enough of a motivating factor (now that I rebuilt the site) to actually make interesting posts.

### Ideas

- Every day carry
- Birding
- Github projects
- Helpful gists
- Travel / Photo blogs
