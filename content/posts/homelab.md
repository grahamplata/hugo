## My RPi prep

### Flash the OS to the SD card
There is no need to make things complicated by messing about with **bespoke** operating systems. 
The Raspberry Pi team have done a great job with Raspbian and for a headless system Raspbian Lite is easy to use and quick to flash.

Raspberry Pi OS Lite

#### Download Raspbian Lite
Mount the SD card and create a text file named ```"ssh"``` in the freshly created boot partition.
- On MacOS you can usually type in: sudo touch /Volumes/boot/ssh for this step
```TODO: Attachs shell script....```
